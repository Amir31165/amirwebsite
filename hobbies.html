    <p>My hobbies and intrest's are Nature, Food, Cars. I love animals i have 2 cat's 1 dog and 4 koi carps (fish).<br> I love walking
        around the fields near where I live I love taking pictures of butterflies and variouse types of plant's.
        I love driving around to different parts of the UK to see the landscape, I like varieties of car's from classic's, modern
        to modefied cars, I like going to open markets or bazzar's, until the online shopping took over as now you don't have to go anywhere
        everythings on the web and at your finger tip.
